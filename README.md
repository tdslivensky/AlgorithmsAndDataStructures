## Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization from coursera 

## **specialization made up of five(5) classes**
###### Note the final capstone course is not yet included in this repo

**1. Algorithmic Toolbox**
The class covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and many others. I learned how to sort and search data, how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively, how to pack a knapsack using greedy algorithms, and how to search for similarities between genes using dynamic programming. This invovled solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing them as efficient software tools.

**2. Data Structures**
In this course, I covered the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. I learned how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and practiced implementing them in programming assignments shown in this repo. I also learned typical use cases for these data structures.

A few examples of questions covered in this class were the following:
1. What is a good strategy of resizing a dynamic array?
2. How priority queues are implemented in Python?
3. How to implement a hash table so that the amortized running time of all operations is O(1) on average?
4. What are good strategies to keep a binary tree balanced?

**3. Algorithms on Graphs**
In this course, I covered what a Graph is and what are some of the most important properties. Then I learned several ways to traverse graphs and how I can do useful things while traversing the graph in some order. I then covered shortest paths algorithms â€” from the basic ones to those which open door for 1000000 times faster algorithms used in Google Maps and other navigational services. The course concludes with minimum spanning trees which are used to plan road, telephone and computer networks and also find applications in clustering and approximate algorithms.

**4. Algorithms on Strings**
In this course, I learned about suffix trees, suffix arrays, and other brilliant algorithmic ideas that help doctors to find differences between genomes and power internet searches.

**5. Advanced Algorithms and Complexity**
Advanced algorithms build upon basic ones and uses new ideas. I started with networks flows, which are used in more obvious applications such as optimal matchings, finding disjoint paths and flight scheduling as well as more surprising ones like image segmentation in computer vision. The course then proceeded to linear programming with applications in optimizing budget allocation, portfolio optimization, finding the cheapest diet satisfying all requirements, call routing in telecommunications and many others. Next the course covered inherently hard problems for which no exact good solutions are known (and not likely to be found) and how to solve them in practice.
